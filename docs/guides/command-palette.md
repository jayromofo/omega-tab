## Command Palette Features

The Command Palette offers quick access to:

2. **Navigation Commands**: Access settings or other parts of the application
3. **Search Engine Switching**: Change your default search engine

::: info Command Palette vs. Search Bar
The search bar and command palette offer similar functions, like searching your links. 

The main difference is the search bar offers web search and access to your search history, which the command palette does not, and the command palette offers access to some settings and quick actions, which the search bar does not.
