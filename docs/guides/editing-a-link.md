Once you've added links to your OmegaTab dashboard, you may want to update them. This guide explains how to edit your existing link cards.

## Accessing the Edit Options

To edit a link, hover over any link card and click the `...` three dot menu that appears. This menu has an Edit option, clicking this will open the Edit Link modal.

The Edit Link modal allows you to modify:

- **URL**: Change the destination of the link
- **Title**: Update the displayed name
- **Description**: Modify or add additional context

3. Enter a new column name
4. Click "Add"
