### Keyboard Shortcuts for Search Engines

Quickly switch between search engines using keyboard shortcuts:
- `Ctrl+↑`: Switch to the previous search engine in the list
- `Ctrl+↓`: Switch to the next search engine in the list

## Searching Your Links

As you type, OmegaTab automatically searches your saved links:

1. Enter any keywords matching your link's title, URL, or description
2. Matching links will appear in a dropdown below the search bar
3. Click on a link or navigate to it with arrow keys and press Enter

## Multi-line Searches

For more complex searches:
- Press **Shift+Enter** to add a new line in your search query
- Press **Enter** to execute the search

## Search History

If you've enabled Search History in your [user settings](/guides/user-settings), OmegaTab will remember your recent searches:

1. Click on the search bar to see recent searches
2. Select any past search to quickly repeat it

## Direct URL Navigation

If you enter a valid URL in the search bar, OmegaTab will navigate directly to that website rather than searching for it:

1. Type a complete URL (e.g., "example.com" or "https://example.com")
2. Press Enter to go directly to that site
