# Creating a New Link

Adding your favorite websites to OmegaTab is quick and simple. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a new link card.

## Ways to Add a New Link

There are three ways to add a new link to your dashboard:

1. Click on the **Add new link** card in your dashboard
2. Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+N`
3. Open the Command Palette with `Ctrl+K` and select "Add New Link"

## Adding a Link Step-by-Step

### 1. Open the Add New Link Modal

Use one of the above methods to open a modal dialog where you can enter your link details.

### 2. Enter Link Details

The Add New Link form contains the following fields:

- **URL** (required): The complete web address of the site you want to add
- **Title** (optional): A name for your link
- **Description** (optional): Additional information about the link
- **Column Label** (required): The category where this link should appear

::: tip Plus+ and Pro Feature
If you leave the title and description blank, OmegaTab will attempt to fetch them automatically from the website, along with an icon. This is available for Plus+ and Pro subscribers.

### 3. Column Organization

The "Column Label" field helps organize your links into groups. You can:

- Select an existing column from the dropdown
- Create a new column by selecting the dropdown and entering a new column name at the bottom


::: tip Column Management
You can move links from one column to other by editing them and changing their column label in the dropdown. After no more links are saved under a column label, it will be deleted. Learn more in [the edit guide](/guides/editing-a-link#column-management).

### 4. Save Your Link

Click the "Add Link" button to save your new link to the dashboard. Typing `enter` when typing in any of the form's input fields (Url, Title, Description) will also save the link, saving you some time.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While adding a link, you can use these keyboard shortcuts:

- `Enter`: Submit the form 
- `Shift+Enter`: Add a new line in the description field

## Link Limitations

- Free accounts are limited to 6 total pins
- Plus subscribers can create additional pins based on their subscription level
- When you reach your maximum pins, the "Add new link" card will change to "Upgrade for more pins"
