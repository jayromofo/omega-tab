# Search Suggestions

OmegaTab offers smart search suggestions that help you find what you're looking for more efficiently. This guide explains how the search suggestions feature works.

## What Are Search Suggestions?

As you type in the search bar, OmegaTab can display a list of suggested search queries that might match what you're looking for. These suggestions can help you:

- Complete your search query faster
- Discover related search terms you hadn't considered
- Fix spelling errors in your query
- Find popular searches related to your topic

## Powered by Brave

OmegaTab's search suggestions are powered by Brave's suggestion API, which provides relevant, privacy-focused search recommendations.

## How to Use Search Suggestions

2. If no matching links are found in your collection, suggestions will appear
3. Use the arrow keys (↑ and ↓) to navigate through the suggestions
4. Press Enter to select a suggestion and perform the search
5. Or click directly on any suggestion to use it

## Privacy Considerations

When using search suggestions:

- Your search query is sent to Brave's API to generate suggestions
- OmegaTab respects your privacy and only sends the minimum data needed
- No personal information is shared with Brave beyond your search query itself

1. Navigate to [User Settings](/guides/user-settings)
2. Find the "Enable Autosuggest (Powered By Brave)" option
3. Toggle the switch to enable or disable suggestions

## When Suggestions Appear

Search suggestions will appear when:

1. You're typing in the search bar
2. No matching links are found in your personal collection
3. Your query doesn't match a complete URL
4. The autosuggest feature is enabled in your settings
