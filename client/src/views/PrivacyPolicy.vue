          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Sharing Your Information</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information with third-party service providers (such as Supabase, Brave, Sentry, and Stripe) to perform functions on our behalf, as described in this Privacy Policy. We may also disclose your information if required by law, to protect our rights, or in connection with a business transfer (e.g., merger or acquisition).
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Data Retention</h2>
          
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. When your data is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, we will delete or anonymize it.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Security of Your Information</h2>

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
            We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. This includes using encryption for data in transit and relying on the security practices of our third-party providers (e.g., Supabase, Stripe). However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
          </p>
